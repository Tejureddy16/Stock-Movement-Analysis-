# Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment

This project uses social media sentiment analysis to predict stock price movements. It scrapes data from Reddit, processes the data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and builds a machine learning model to predict stock movements based on the sentiment of discussions related to stocks.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Scraping**: Scraping Reddit data (subreddits related to stocks).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Performing sentiment analysis on the scraped data.
4. **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model to predict stock movement (up/down).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The main code is written in the Jupyter notebook `capx_assessment.ipynb`.
